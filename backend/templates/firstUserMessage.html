<p>Please note that if you will not confirm or decline resource usage, your event will be automatically deleted after {{notification}} days after this email is sent.</p>

<p>P.S. It has been noted that there are cases when shared resource are booked and not used. Such cases cause inconveniences for other people that would like to book a meeting room but cannot since it was already booked. So this is ok to book the shared resource if you intend to use it. But it is not advised to book the resource but not use it.</p>
<p>P.P.S. Your colleagues would be asked to confirm bookings as well. It is on-going resource usage optimization process. Let please respect others by freeing unused resources.</p>
